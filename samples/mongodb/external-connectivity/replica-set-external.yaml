    # replicaSetHorizons consists of a list of maps where each map represents a node within
    # the replica set and maps names of DNS horizons to externally connectable DNS names.
    # In the following example, this would allow a client to make a replica set connection
    # from outside the replica set using a connection string like
    # mongodb://mdb0-test-website.com:1337,mdb1-test-website.com:1338,mdb2-test-website.com:1339.
    # The length of the replicaSetHorizons list must be equal to the number of the members in the
    # replica set and each member should have all of the same DNS horizon names specified.
