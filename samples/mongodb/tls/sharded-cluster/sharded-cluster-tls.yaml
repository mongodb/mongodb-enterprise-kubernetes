  # This will create a TLS enabled Sharded Cluster, which means that
  # all the traffic between Shards and clients will be encrypted using
  # TLS certificates.  These certificates will be generated on the fly
  # by the operator using the Kubernetes CA.  Please refer to
  # Kubernetes TLS Documentation on how to approve these certs:
